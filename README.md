# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Demonstration on Third-Party APIs on this work day scheduler:
- saves information into local storage and retrieves it
- changes color based on current hour - using bootstrap and javascript
- demonstrates jquery's JSON stringify method

## How to us:
1. Enter activities for the day
2. Return any time to see the activities in an easy to read color coded format.
